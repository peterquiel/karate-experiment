= My Karate Experiments

Karate is a truly DSL to test web apis - see https://github.com/intuit/karate.

This repository is my sandbox, a place where I put my experiments.

== Motivation

Karate offers already https://github.com/intuit/karate/tree/master/karate-demo[many examples and demos] but as everybody should know:

> There is no better teacher than experience itself

That's why I create my own little experiments. I try to use the https://popcornflow.com[popcornflow] to structure experiments and having
expectations upfront. Comparing my expectations with that what really happened enables me to learn.

== Lessons Learned
